Single Sign-on with Windows Identity Foundation
--------

An example of implementing single sign-on with federated authentication via Windows Identity Foundation in C# MVC ASP .NET.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps of implementing federated authentication with single sign-on. We'll create an MVC ASP .NET web site and a common authentication web site identity provider (also called a Secure Token Service or STS). The identity provider web site will provide the login form, using forms authentication, and redirect back to the calling web site.
